Bootstrap, Bulma,\r\n      Tailwind - they all are great in their way, but still too much for some\r\n      things. For the basic page, I have created Raincoat. It is a small,\r\n      opinionated set of styles, built to get you a swift start where you need\r\n      it.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n      Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated.<br>\r\n      ~ Confucius\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n      This quote expresses a lot of my own thought process. It is essentially\r\n      the same reason why I enjoy working with Svelte or Vue a lot more than\r\n      with React. No hate there, React is cool in it's own pure JS way. But is\r\n      this really necessary? Why not using sensible abstractions to remove the\r\n      clunky parts, and make your own code more slick?\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n      The <code>Raincoat CSS</code> framework should be easy to use. Edit the\r\n      <code>_config.scss</code>, and the fun begins.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <pre><code>&lt;article class=\"prose\"&gt;\r\n  &lt;h1&gt;Garlic bread with cheese: What the science tells us&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n  &lt;p&gt;\r\n    For years parents have espoused the health benefits of eating garlic bread with cheese to their\r\n    children, with the food earning such an iconic status in our culture that kids will often dress\r\n    up as warm, cheesy loaf for Halloween.\r\n  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n  &lt;p&gt;\r\n    But a recent study shows that the celebrated appetizer may be linked to a series of rabies cases\r\n    springing up around the country.\r\n  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n  &lt;!-- ... --&gt;\r\n&lt;/article&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\r\n  </body>\r\n</html>\r\n"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"8a8ec23ab33ce4f74bacdc106ce72538","cacheData":{}}
