    <h1>Raincoat CSS - base styles</h1>

    <p>
      Often, we reach out for a framework to do a simple task. Bootstrap, Bulma,
      Tailwind - they all are great in their way, but still too much for some
      things. For the basic page, I have created Raincoat. It is a small,
      opinionated set of styles, built to get you a swift start where you need
      it.

      This quote expresses a lot of my own thought process. It is essentially
      the same reason why I enjoy working with Svelte or Vue a lot more than
      with React. No hate there, React is cool in it's own pure JS way. But is
      this really necessary? Why not using sensible abstractions to remove the
      clunky parts, and make your own code more slick?

      The <code>Raincoat CSS</code> framework should be easy to use. Edit the
      <code>_config.scss</code>, and the fun begins.

  &lt;h1&gt;Garlic bread with cheese: What the science tells us&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    For years parents have espoused the health benefits of eating garlic bread with cheese to their
    children, with the food earning such an iconic status in our culture that kids will often dress
    up as warm, cheesy loaf for Halloween.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    But a recent study shows that the celebrated appetizer may be linked to a series of rabies cases
    springing up around the country.
