        <h1>Raincoat CSS - base styles</h1>

        <p>
            Often, we reach out for a framework to do a simple task. Bootstrap,
            Bulma, Tailwind - they all are great in their way, but still too
            much for some things. For the basic page, I have created Raincoat.
            It is a small, opinionated set of styles, built to get you a swift
            start where you need it.

            This quote expresses a lot of my own thought process. It is
            essentially the same reason why I enjoy working with Svelte or Vue a
            lot more than with React. No hate there, React is cool in it's own
            pure JS way. But is this really necessary? Why not using sensible
            abstractions to remove the clunky parts, and make your own code more
            slick?

            The <code>Raincoat CSS</code> framework should be easy to use. Edit
            the <code>_config.scss</code>, and the fun begins.

  &lt;h1&gt;Garlic bread with cheese: What the science tells us&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    For years parents have espoused the health benefits of eating garlic bread with cheese to their
    children, with the food earning such an iconic status in our culture that kids will often dress
    up as warm, cheesy loaf for Halloween.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    But a recent study shows that the celebrated appetizer may be linked to a series of rabies cases
    springing up around the country.
  &lt;/p&gt;

            As I want to encourage people to check out anything great, here are
            some alternatives, also compiled by the awesome
            <a href="https://css-tricks.com">CSS-Tricks</a>:

        <h3>Here are some tasks for this miniature framework to solve:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Easy to configure!</li>
            <li>Easy to use!</li>
            <li>Easy to go!</li>

        <h2>Are images okay?</h2>
        <figure>
            <img

                alt=""
            />
            <figcaption>
                Images should look okay. Even if your content is generated from
                a CMS or a md-file.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h2>Oh yeah, have some tables:</h2>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>1</th>
                    <th>2</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>3</td>
                    <td>4</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>5</td>
                    <td>6</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <h3>Other elements</h3>
        <h4>Font Sizes?</h4>
        <p>We should only change font sizes for new breakpoints. ;)</p>
        <h2>Why no form elements?</h2>
        <p>
            This is more focused on text styling at the moment. But we will see
            what the future brings! Maybe I add some form element styling
            eventually. For now, it is not needed.
